near call <contractId> create '{"message":"<message here>"}' --accountId <accountId>
```

**Gift a coffe**

```
near call <contractId>  gift '{"id": <coffe id>"}' --account_id <accountId> --amount 1
```

**Get the coffes**

```
near view <contractId>  get '{"offset":"<offset here>", "limit":"<limit here>"}' --accountId <accountId>
```
